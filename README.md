# Is The Cricket On

Needlessly over-engineered app to play around with interesting tech including;

- TypeScript
- Node, Express
- React, NextJS
- GraphQL, Apollo
- Redis
- Styled Components

## To run:

1. `brew install nvm`
2. `nvm install 8`
3. `brew install yarn`
4. `yarn`
5. `yarn dev` The app runs at `localhost:8000`
6. `yarn test` This will run the unit tests.
7. `yarn lint` Runs prettier and tslint - this happens automatically for staged files in a pre-commit hook.
8. `yarn build` For a production build.
